**Mathematical Modeling (7th Semester, ITMO University)**

This repository contains projects developed during the 7th semester of the Mathematical Modeling course at ITMO University. The work focuses on various mathematical physics and statistical modeling tasks, including:

 **Multidimensional Heat Equation:** Modeling and discretizing continuous problems using finite difference methods.  
 **Lotka-Volterra System:** Developing a finite difference scheme for the "predator-prey" system in a two-dimensional spatial domain.  
 **Maxwell's Demon Efficiency:** Calculating the efficiency coefficient of a Maxwell's demon-inspired filter through statistical modeling, simulating particle motion and capture mechanisms.  
 **Asset Price Dependencies:** Analyzing statistical simulation results to identify dependencies in asset quotations.  
 **Queuing Systems:** Modeling the behavior of mass service systems using different approaches.

The repository includes code implementations, simulation results, and analytical insights for each project.
